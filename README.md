# odin-rock-paper-scissors

A game of rock paper scissors played against the computer entirely in the console.

When the player enters a text value of "rock," "paper," or "scissors," the computer randomly selects one of those three choices as well. The winner of each round is determined by the usual scheme, and after five rounds the game is over.
